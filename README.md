This is competency code sample. It's simple MVC ASP.NET Framework application that uses EntityFramework to perform crud opperations in MS SQL database. The UI is spa-like and built on Razor views with jQuery, bootstrap, and knockout.js (I know, I know; but these things were perfectly acceptable when the app was first created).
