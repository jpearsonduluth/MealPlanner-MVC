# MealPlanner-MVC

This is a competency code sample. It's a simple MVC ASP.NET Framework application that uses EntityFramework to perform CRUD opperations in a MS SQL database. The UI is spa-like and built on Razor views with jQuery, bootstrap, and knockout.js (I know, I know; but these things were perfectly acceptable when the app was first created). Please note that this is *not* a fully realized or fleshed out application; nor is it intended to be.
